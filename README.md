### buy a 4k monitor for overcome your font addiction!
### use the default font and get the f\*\*king job done!

### Best fonts for programming
1. Aurulent: it looks like written by Lamy-pen, add missing glyphs from fira code;
2. Consolas: hinted, a better version for Windows 7, you need system font replacer tool or rename the family name;
3. Menlo: it's TheSans font, beautiful font for both screen and print, my favorite;
4. Droid Sans Mono: Android official monospace font, slashed zero. it's most legible font for long time reading IMHO;
5. Source Code Pro: medium as regular, the medium looks like written by art fountain pen, the official default hint is really beautiful on Windows 7;
6. Fira Code: [most popular coding font](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode)
7. JuliaMono: [a font for math programming](https://github.com/cormullion/juliamono), it contains 8000+ glyphs, many math sign symbols;

#### Tips:
1. only use the unhinted font when your monitor screen has high ppi(2K/4K monitor).
2. change the font family name by [fontname](https://github.com/chrissimpkins/fontname.py) if the family name conflict with system font.
   usage:

```bash
python fontname.py "NewConsolas" Consolas-Regular.ttf # or ./*.ttf
```
